# tic-tac-toe
A Simple Command Line Tic-Tac-Toe Game, With 2 Modes (Computer VS Player and Player VS Player)

## Steps:-
1. Create the 3x3 grid structure of the game using some simple cout statements with help of an 2D array to denote the elements.
2. There are two input functions, one for the Player VS Player mode and one for the Computer VS Player mode and assign particular symbol ('X' | 'O') to the array on specific position.
3. Construct a boolean function to check if it's a WIN or a DRAW by determining if there is a horizontal, vertical or diagonal match or if it is a tie situation.
